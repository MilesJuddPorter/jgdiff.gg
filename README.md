3rd Party League of Legends Jungler Data Insight Tool


How it works:

Uses a riot games API wrapped called Cassiopeia:
https://cassiopeia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


The program will pull data on the enemy jungler's last 30 games

It will then sort and clean this data in order to produce graphs to provide you insight on how your opponent plays
